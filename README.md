# NNG4

This is the lean4 version of the classical *Natural Number Game*. It uses
the [Lean4 Game Engine](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4game) and is
running live at [adam.math.hhu.de](https://adam.math.hhu.de).

The game was initially designed for lean3 and has been adapted for lean4. [See lean3 version](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/).

## Getting Started

You can develop the game as any lean project and use `lake build` to build it.

Moreover, there are multiple ways to run the game while developing it, which are described in
[Running Games Locally](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4game/blob/main/doc/running_locally.md)
