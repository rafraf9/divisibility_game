Introduction
"
`add_comm b c` is a proof that `b + c = c + b`. But if your goal
is `a + b + c = a + c + b` then `rw [add_comm b c]` will not
work! Because the goal means `(a + b) + c = (a + c) + b` so there
is no `b + c` term *directly* in the goal.

Use associativity and commutativity to prove `add_right_comm`.
You don't need induction. `add_assoc` moves brackets around,
and `add_comm` moves variables around.

Remember that you can do more targetted rewrites by
adding explicit variables as inputs to theorems. For example `rw [add_comm b]`
will only do rewrites of the form `b + ? = ? + b`, and `rw [add_comm b c]`
will only do rewrites of the form `b + c = c + b`.

/-- `add_right_comm a b c` is a proof that `(a + b) + c = (a + c) + b`

In Lean, `a + b + c` means `(a + b) + c`, so this result gets displayed
as `a + b + c = a + c + b`.
