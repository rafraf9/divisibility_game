Introduction
"
You can prove $1\\times m=m$ in at least three ways.
Either by induction, or by using `succ_mul`, or
by using commutativity. Which do you think is quickest?
"

/--  `one_mul m` is the proof `1 * m = m`. -/
TheoremDoc MyNat.one_mul as "one_mul" in "*"

/-- For any natural number $m$, we have $ 1 \times m = m$. -/
Statement one_mul
    (m : â„•): 1 * m = m := by
  rw [mul_comm, mul_one]
  rfl
