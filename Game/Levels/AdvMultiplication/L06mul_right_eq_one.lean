# Summary

The `have` tactic can be used to add new hypotheses to a level, but of course
you have to prove them.


## Example

The simplest usage is like this. If you have `a` in your context and you execute

`have ha : a = 0`

then you will get a new goal `a = 0` to prove, and after you've proved
it you will have a new hypothesis `ha : a = 0` in your original goal.

## Example

If you already have a proof of what you want to `have`, you
can just create it immediately. For example, if you have `a` and `b`
number objects, then

`have h2 : succ a = succ b → a = b := succ_inj a b`

will directly add a new hypothesis `h2 : succ a = succ b → a = b`
to the context, because you just supplied the proof of it (`succ_inj a b`).

## Example

If you have a proof to hand, then you don't even need to state what you
are proving. example

`have h2 := succ_inj a b`

will add `h2 : succ a = succ b → a = b` as a hypothesis.

Introduction
"
This level proves `x * y = 1 → x = 1`, the multiplicative analogue of Advanced Addition
World's `x + y = 0 → x = 0`. The strategy is to prove that `x ≤ 1` and then use the
lemma `le_one` from `≤` world.

We'll prove it using a new and very useful tactic called `have`.

Statement mul_right_eq_one (x y : ℕ) (h : x * y = 1) : x = 1 := by
  Hint (strict := true) "We want to use `le_mul_right`, but we need a hypothesis `x * y ≠ 0`
  which we don't have. Yet. Execute `have h2 : x * y ≠ 0` (you can type `≠` with `\\ne`).
  You'll be asked to
  prove it, and then you'll have a new hypothesis which you can apply
  `le_mul_right` to."
