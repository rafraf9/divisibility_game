Introduction "
We've proved that `x ≤ 0` implies `x = 0`. The last two levels
in this world will prove which numbers are `≤ 1` and `≤ 2`.
This lemma will be helpful for them.

/-- If $\operatorname{succ}(x) \leq \operatorname{succ}(y)$ then $x \leq y$. -/
Statement succ_le_succ (x y : ℕ) (hx : succ x ≤ succ y) : x ≤ y := by
  cases hx with d hd
  use d
  rw [succ_add] at hd
  apply succ_inj at hd
  exact hd

Conclusion "
Here's my proof:
```
cases hx with d hd
use d
rw [succ_add] at hd
apply succ_inj at hd
exact hd
```
