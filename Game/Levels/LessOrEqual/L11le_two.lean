/-- `le_two x` is a proof that if `x ≤ 2` then `x = 0` or `x = 1` or `x = 2`. -/

Introduction "
We'll need this lemma to prove that two is prime!

You'll need to know that `∨` is right associative. This means that
`x = 0 ∨ x = 1 ∨ x = 2` actually means `x = 0 ∨ (x = 1 ∨ x = 2)`.
This affects how `left` and `right` work.

/-- If $x \leq 2$ then $x = 0$ or $1$ or $2$. -/

Conclusion "
Nice!

The next step in the development of order theory is to develop
the theory of the interplay between `≤` and multiplication.
