/-- `le_antisymm x y` is a proof that if `x ≤ y` and `y ≤ x` then `x = y`. -/
TheoremDoc MyNat.le_antisymm as "le_antisymm" in "≤"

Introduction "
This level asks you to prove *antisymmetry* of $\\leq$.
In other words, if $x \\leq y$ and $y \\leq x$ then $x = y$.
It's the trickiest one so far. Good luck!

Conclusion "
Here's my proof:
```
cases hxy with a ha
cases hyx with b hb
rw [ha]
rw [ha, add_assoc] at hb
symm at hb
apply add_right_eq_self at hb
apply add_right_eq_zero at hb
rw [hb, add_zero]
rfl
```

A passing mathematician remarks that with antisymmetry as well,
you have proved that `≤` is a *partial order* on `ℕ`.

The boss level of this world is to prove
that `≤` is a total order. Let's learn two more easy tactics
first.
