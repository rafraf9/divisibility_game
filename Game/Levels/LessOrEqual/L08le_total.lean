Introduction "
This is I think the toughest level yet. Tips: if `a` is a number
then `cases a with b` will split into cases `a = 0` and `a = succ b`.
And don't go left or right until your hypotheses guarantee that
you can prove the resulting goal!

Conclusion "
Very well done.

A passing mathematician remarks that with you've just proved that `ℕ` is totally
ordered.

The final few levels in this world are much easier.
