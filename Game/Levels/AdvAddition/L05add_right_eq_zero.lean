Introduction
"The next result we'll need in `≤` World is that if `a + b = 0` then `a = 0` and `b = 0`.
Let's prove one of these facts in this level, and the other in the next.

## A new tactic: `cases`

The `cases` tactic will split an object or hypothesis up into the possible ways
that it could have been created.

For example, sometimes you want to deal with the two cases `b = 0` and `b = succ d` separately,
but don't need the inductive hypothesis `hd` that comes with `induction b with d hd`.
In this situation you can use `cases b with d` instead. There are two ways to make
a number: it's either zero or a successor. So you will end up with two goals, one
with `b = 0` and one with `b = succ d`.

Another example: if you have a hypothesis `h : False` then you are done, because a false statement implies
any statement. Here `cases h` will close the goal, because there are *no* ways to
make a proof of `False`! So you will end up with no goals, meaning you have proved everything.

## Summary

If `n` is a number, then `cases n with d` will break the goal into two goals,
one with `n = 0` and the other with `n = succ d`.

If `h` is a proof (for example a hypothesis), then `cases h with...` will break the
proof up into the pieces used to prove it.

## Example

If `n : ℕ` is a number, then `cases n with d` will break the goal into two goals,
one with `n` replaced by 0 and the other with `n` replaced by `succ d`. This
corresponds to the mathematical idea that every natural number is either `0`
or a successor.

## Example

If `h : P ∨ Q` is a hypothesis, then `cases h with hp hq` will turn one goal
into two goals, one with a hypothesis `hp : P` and the other with a
hypothesis `hq : Q`.

## Example

If `h : False` is a hypothesis, then `cases h` will turn one goal into no goals,
because there are no ways to make a proof of `False`! And if you have no goals left,
you have finished the level.

## Example

If `h : a ≤ b` is a hypothesis, then `cases h with c hc` will create a new number `c`
and a proof `hc : b = a + c`. This is because the *definition* of `a ≤ b` is
`∃ c, b = a + c`.
