TacticDoc decide "
The `decide` tactic is able to prove goals involving *known numerals*. It is not
good with algebra, so don't give it goals with `x`s in, but it can prove
things like `2 + 2 = 4` and even `20 + 20 = 40` automatically.

When run on `MyNat` goals, the tactic uses the decidable equality instance
on `MyNat` in `Game.MyNat.DecidableEq`. The implementation
is not at all optimised: I just wanted to get something which could beat
humans easily.
